              for breakfast (lol) just put it in the small square dish and
              microwave for 8 seconds. She'll love it. Other than that, she gets
              <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> Cup of food daily. Will graze if
              she's hungry but will mainly eat in the evening.

                She's an inside dog through and through but can handle outside

                allergy treat.

                Usually goes potty around this time. If it's not hot, she can
                take a 20ish minute walk here, too. She can have a cranberry or
                allergy treat here, too. Opposite of whatever she got earlier.

              Wish there was a better way to say it but...she still eats poop.
              It's stupid and embarassing. She'll do a stupid spin while pooping
              but just pull her leash up and she'll stay still.

              She likes to play with a bunch of different toys. She likes
              finding her tennis ball when it's hidden, chasing the ball to go
              get some water or food, wrestling/biting her pillow and any of her
              fluffy toys.

              We like to just give her some good pats after she eats and drinks
              water bc it's funny to hear her burp. She might come up to you
